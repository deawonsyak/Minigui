How to write Data Source Query Language?

Text Data Source:
	Now Text Data Source don't support the expression descript in the documents, only '*' support, which means that select all the lines.
	'$' + <Num> mean select which columns, from number 1, eg:
		*:            -- select all lines and all columns
		*:{$1,$2,$3}  -- select all lines and column 1, 2, 3


Etc Data Source:
	Etc Data Source support two kind formats:
	1. select key and values from a section, eg.
		/system:{$1,$2}                --- select all the keys($1) and values($2) in the section "system"
		/system/gal_engine:{$1,$2}     --- select all the keys($1) and values($2) in the section whose is equal [system] gal_engine's value
	2. select an array from a section:
		<section-path>@<count-key>:{$<field1-key-name>, $<field2-key-name>...}
		
		* section-path: same as format 1, eg. /system, /upf, /qpf .etc
		* count-key: the key of section indicate the count of array, such as [upf] font_number, etc
		* field-key-name: the key name of field, such as "name", "fontfile" of upf section. the fact key is "name1", or "value1", etc ., the number must from '0'


The example of test.txt:
	*:
	*:{$1,$8}
	*:{$2,$8}
	*:{$8}

The example of text.ini
	/test:{$1,$2}
	/array@count:{$key,$value}
